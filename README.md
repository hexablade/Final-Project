== Description ==

This is the long description.  No limit, and you can use Markdown (as well as in the following sections).

The game is simply. Sort of like an old Mario game style. In the game you are Pikachu and you have to travel along a minecraft floor game avioding the zombies from killing you. You get 3 lives and the background song is Dynamite by Taio Cruz.

To compile simply use make and the makefile should efficiently handle everything.

If you need to, download the following ssl libraries: mixer, ttf, and the image header files in order to run things. 

you can edit the character images by replacing them with the images, but remember to rename your images to the name already given to them.

You can also use the functions in the source code to develop your own game. They are spread into files so you can easily see where things are defined and coming from. 

== Installation ==


1. Make sure you have all the SDL plugins necessary mentioned above.
1. compile using the makefile. 
1. run the program.
